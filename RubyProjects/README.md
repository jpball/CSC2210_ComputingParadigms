The following projects were assignments given during the Ruby/OOP section of my Computing Paradigms course.

# Projects

## P1: Date Difference Calculator
This project had us writing a program that will calculate the number of days between 2 dates.

## P2: Consecutive Difference Calculator
This project had us creating a program that would perform different things on consecutive prime number pairs. 
Actions that the program needed to perform included:
- print all consecutive primes in pairs like this [2 3][3 5][5 7]...
- return an array of the differences between the consecutive primes
- return an array of the values directly in the middle of the primes
- return an array of all of the primes (not in pairs)
- find the average difference between consecutive primes
- find the minimum and maximum difference between consecutive primes in a range

## P3: File System Manager
This project had us creating a program able to manipulate files and directories on the file system.
The main class had the ability to manage directories and files specifically, allowing the user to perform actions on each type of item as desired. This class also had the ability to create groups of files, such as "media" files, in order to perform desired actions on each item within that group. We were also require to write various test cases in order to test our program's functionality.
