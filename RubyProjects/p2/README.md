# Project 2: Prime Number Generator

This project had us creating a program that would perform different things on consecutive prime number pairs. Actions that the program needed to perform included:

- print all consecutive primes in pairs like this [2 3][3 5][5 7]...
- return an array of the differences between the consecutive primes
- return an array of the values directly in the middle of the primes
- return an array of all of the primes (not in pairs)
- find the average difference between consecutive primes
- find the minimum and maximum difference between consecutive primes in a range
