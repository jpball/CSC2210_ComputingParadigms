The square root of 110
For this elusive number, where do I look
It is like searching for a long lost friend in a phone book

Somewhere between one and one-ten it must be
Pick a value in the middle, square it, and see

If the squared value is bigger than one-ten
Make the middle value the brand new end

If the squared value falls somewhere in between
Move the start to where the middle had been

Repeat 'til the square matches our number
Our lost friend has been found, awoken from slumber
