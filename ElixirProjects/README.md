# Elixir Projects
 
The following projects were assignments given during the Elixir/Functional Programming section of my Computing Paradigms course.

### P4: File Redactor
This project had us creating a program that would redact a set of words from a file. The words to be redacted would come from another separate text file. This program would also have the ability to do the inverse of this, redacting everything but the words from a separate text file.

### P5: Integral Calculator
This project had us creating a program that would calculate the area underneath a curve given a mathematical function, using Riemann Sums. This calculation would be multithreaded in order to increase speed.
