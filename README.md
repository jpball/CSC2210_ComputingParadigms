# CSC2210_ComputingParadigms

This repository houses my code from my Computing Paradigms course.

This course featured us learning 3 different languages, each demonstrating a different programming paradigms.
### The languages covered were:
- Ruby
- Elixir
- Clojure

Each language featured several lab problems, which had us create small and simple programs to practice with the paradigm and language, as well as a few larger projects, which had us create more complex programs to demonstrate our understanding of the paradigm and language.
