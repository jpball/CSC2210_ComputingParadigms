# Clojure Projects
 
The following project was the assignment given during the Clojure/LISP section of my Computing Paradigms course.

## P6: Base-10 Birthday
This project had us writing a program that will utilize lazy generators in order to calculate a certain number of days past a given start date, and eventually use that to calculate our Base-10 birthdays (every 1000 days since you were born).
